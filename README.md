# QGSA-Optimization-Algorithm

This code consists of five parts: start.m (main file), Chromosome_Generator.m, Fitness_Evaluation.m, Best_Chromosome_Finder.m, Update_Of_Betta.m

Open up the start.m, first of all at the initialization phase algorithm parameters are tuned.

In the first function, some chromosomes are generated.
Fitnesses are evaluated in the second function.
We find the best chromosome and update the betta.
